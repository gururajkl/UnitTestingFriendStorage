A small automated test coded by the programmer, that verifies wheather or not a small piece 
of production code - a unit - works as expected in isolation.

Effective unit tests are F.I.R.S.T

F -> Fast to run them frequently.

I -> Unit tests should be independent of each other, meaning they should not 
rely on the state or execution of other tests. Each test should be able to run in isolation.

R -> Unit tests should produce the same results every time they are run, regardless 
of the environment or order of execution. They should not have any external dependencies 
that can introduce variability.

S ->  Unit tests should have a boolean output (pass/fail) and should automatically assert 
their own results. A test should be able to determine its success or failure without manual 
intervention.

T -> Unit tests should be written in a timely manner, preferably before the code 
being tested is implemented. They should be an integral part of the development process 
and contribute to the overall quality of the code.

SOME OF THE FRAMEWORKS AVAILABLE ARE -> MSTest (Comes with VS), 
NUnit(Complete rewrite of JUnit for .NET), 
XUnit(Written by the original inventor of the NUnit v2).

* To run xunit in vs i installed xunit, xunit.runner.visualstudio, Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk

* In xunit we use [Fact] attribute instead of [TestMethod()]

* To pass any parameter we use [Theory] attribute and to pass the data we can use [InlineData]
attribute, the order should be same as in the parameter of the test method
ex: [InlineData(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)]
	public void Test(int a, int b, int c) { }

* A cube is important in the xunit test Assign, Act, Assert
